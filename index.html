            This happened, indeed, to the train in which Mr. Fogg was
            travelling. About twelve o'clock a troop of ten or twelve thousand
            head of buffalo encumbered the track. The locomotive, slackening its
            speed, tried to clear the way with its cowâ€“catcher; but the mass of
            animals was too great. The buffaloes marched along with a tranquil
            gait, uttering now and then deafening bellowings. There was no use
            of interrupting them, for, having taken a particular direction,
            nothing can moderate and change their course; it is a torrent of
            living flesh which no dam could contain.

            The travellers gazed on this curious spectacle from the platforms;
            but Phileas Fogg, who had the most reason of all to be in a hurry,
            remained in his seat, and waited philosophically until it should
            please the buffaloes to get out of the way.

            Passepartout was furious at the delay they occasioned, and longed to
            discharge his arsenal of revolvers upon them.

            "What a country!" cried he. "Mere cattle stop the trains, and go by
            in a procession, just as if they were not impeding travel! Parbleu!
            I should like to know if Mr. Fogg foresaw this mishap in his
            programme! And here's an engineer who doesn't dare to run the
            locomotive into this herd of beasts!"
